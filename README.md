Completed this project as part of my Data Science and Machine Learning Internship with United Network of Professionals (UNP). Key highlights:

-> Studied and Analyzed the Student Grade Prediction dataset to applying ML models and present my insights.
-> Performed various Exploratory Data Analysis to understand the data and compare the variables.
-> Experimented with different Machine Learning algorithms, Linear Regression, Svm ,Knn, Bagging, and Boosting.
-> Compared the results to recommend the best Regression model.
